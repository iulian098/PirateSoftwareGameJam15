      text: 'Manufacturing slime was easier than expected.


        It was a fairly
        random discovery, because Warden Nettle did not bother to bury those he executed.


        It
        appears as though the sludge leaking out of the bodies eventually gathered
        and sprung to life.


        We don''t know how it lives, but it appears
        as though it requires a certain amount for it to move at all.


        The
        slime, in combination with water, creates acid, which sells for a decent
        amount of gold per vial.'
